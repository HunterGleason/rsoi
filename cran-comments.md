## Resubmission
As requested I have re-submitted. This version:

* Changed title to title case
* Removed redundant "An R package to" and simply started Description with "Downloads"
* Added web references to the Description.

## Test environments

* local Windows 10, R 3.3.3
* ubuntu, os x, R 3.3.3 (travis-ci)
* win-builder (devel and release)
* Windows, R 3.3.3 (on appveyor)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  ENSO (3:38)
  El (3:8)
  Nino (3:11, 7:133)
  
All words are correctly spelled.
